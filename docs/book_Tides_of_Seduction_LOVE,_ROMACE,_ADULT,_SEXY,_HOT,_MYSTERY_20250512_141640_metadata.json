The golden green light illuminating my way. \u201cA whole new world Deep within the shallow land.\u201d I walked into a trance for who knows how long. I am jolted out of my state by a chime. The alarm ringing.  (7 am, Sunday, 5th December 2020, Los Angeles)  Thankfully I don\u2019t have a morning class today. I wake up like the usuals and start on my routine thinking about the dream I just had. \u201chaaahh\u2026.\u201d (I sigh). Seems they won\u2019t be disappearing any time soon. The weird dreams I have been having ever since I turned 18. It\u2019s been six months already with not a day amiss. They just seem senseless to me yet quite familiar. I think hard trying to recall the parts. Have I missed something? I ask myself. It\u2019s the strange sense of familiarity I feel every time I wake up as if I had been there. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Feeling frustrated, I jump on my bed staring at the ceiling of my room.  (Jessica Holdens,18 yrs. old) (I am a nature enthusiast. Its exactly where my heart resides. \u201cthe nature\u201d. \u201cThe deep blue ocean\u201d. I love gazing at the waves, dripping my feet into the soothing water and gentle water currents being swept over my toes. The calm tranquil breeze, sitting at the shore and counting the stars. Pure bliss of course. Yeah, you are right! I am quite carefree and love to explore. A daydreamer to be honest. Being all serious and practical seems just not the thing for me. I love solace and the comfort that it brings to me. I have always been a quiet girl too. Rather than sitting with a bunch of people talking life or having fun I would prefer being close to the nature \u201cAlone\u201d. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have any friends. Evaline and Christina, my two sweetest best friends ever since my high school started. Westridge school, the school I go to. Oh! How could I forget Jayden, The most popular guy in my high school whom I grew up with. My neighbour and so called boy best friend. We are really close but he is annoying. I don\u2019t want to be the centre of attention everywhere I go. But he seems to be just it. I live with the Holdens since I was 12. They both are really sweet and loving towards me. All these years the affection I received from them makes me emotional. I feel like crying thinking what I did to deserve and meet such warm hearted humans. My mom and Dad.

Jessica Holdens, an introverted, ocean-loving 18-year-old with a lifelong pull toward the sea, begins experiencing vivid, recurring dreams filled with whispers, glimmers of another world, and a strange sense of homecoming. Ever since her 18th birthday, the dreams have become relentless\u2014each one dragging her deeper into a realm hidden beneath the shallow crust of reality. That world, veiled in blue mist and ancient magic, calls to her. And one night, the call becomes impossible to ignore.  On a seemingly normal Sunday morning in Los Angeles, Jessica is thrust into a surreal chain of events\u2014an overwhelming vision, a flash of light, and then darkness. When she awakens, it\u2019s not her bedroom she sees, but an endless ocean that shimmers with sentient energy. The Blueward Deep, a forgotten world buried beneath myth, has claimed her.  There, she learns she is not simply a visitor\u2014but heir to an ancient lineage bound to the sea\u2019s magic. Endowed with a rare affinity called Soulcurrent, Jessica can commune with the waters, bend currents to her will, and even awaken the memories of the ocean itself. But her arrival is no accident: the world of Selmyra is under siege, not by natural forces\u2014but by a shadowy faction that seeks to control the ocean\u2019s ancient power for their own dark purposes.  Known as the Drowned Court, these power-hungry villains have mastered the ability to manipulate the waters of Selmyra, twisting the once-harmonious currents into instruments of destruction. They have summoned monstrous sea beasts and corrupted the ocean's magic to sow chaos across the realms, creating violent storms and dark rifts in the sea. Worse, they are slowly awakening an ancient force known only as The Abyss, an ancient god-like entity that slumbers beneath the ocean's depths, whose awakening could bring Selmyra to the brink of total annihilation.  As Jessica navigates this new reality, her deep empathy and love for the ocean make her an unexpected force in the battle against the Drowned Court. Guided by visions of a girl lost to the waves\u2014and cryptic flashbacks that may not even be her own\u2014Jessica must uncover the truth behind her connection to Selmyra, the mysterious rescue on the beach years ago, and the truth of the Tideborn lineage that runs through her veins.  Can a dreamer become the anchor of a world threatened by madness and malice?  Her journey will take her deep into the heart of Selmyra\u2019s secrets\u2014where betrayal lurks beneath the waves, alliances are tested by hidden agendas, and the ocean itself holds its breath. As a Tideborn with the rare gift of Soulcurrent, Jessica will have to awaken her full potential to prevent the rise of The Abyss, defeat the Drowned Court, and restore balance to the seas before Selmyra is swallowed by the depths.\"\"",
